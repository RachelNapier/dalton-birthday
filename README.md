# Dalton // 24 — Birthday Web App

**Built by Rachel<𝟑**

Happy Birthday, Dalton! ⊹ ࣪ ˖🍰₊˚⊹♡

This is a tiny, installable web app. Open it in your browser, play the theme song, leave notes, and check off little quests together.

## How to use
1. Open the site (GitHub Pages link).
2. In **Theme Song Terminal**, paste a **YouTube** or **Spotify** link.
3. Add a memory in **Memory Shards** or post in **Love Terminal**.
4. Optional: try the secret! (hint: name + age)
5. Save to your phone:
   - **iPhone (Safari):** Share → Add to Home Screen
   - **Android (Chrome):** ⋮ → Add to Home screen / Install app

## Local-only data
Notes, chat, and checklist save **only** in your browser (localStorage). Each device has its own saved state.

## Developer notes
- PWA manifest: `manifest.webmanifest`
- Service worker: `sw.js`
- Icons: PNGs in this folder (maskable icon included for Android cropping)
- Entry point: `index.html` (same content as `index-pwa.html`)

Enjoy! — Rachel
